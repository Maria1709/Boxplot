# Boxplot

Summary of the history of the box plot.
A box plot is a visual represenation of the statistical five number summary a the data set that is given.
This includes
1.Minimum
2.First Quartile
3.Median (second quartile)
4. Third quartile
5. Maximum


Mathematican John Tukey was the first to introduce the Box and WHisker plot in 1969 to show a visual summery of the five number summary of any given data set. A man called Hadley Williams describes them, he says boxplots use robust summary statistics that are always located at actual data points, are quickly computable and have no tuning parameters, and are usefull to compare distributions across groups.
The chartio version is the closest to the original and is used to take a subset of data and quickly and visually show the five number summary data set. But in the chartio version it has a tool tip is provided that shows all of the data points summarised in the visualisation.

The five number summary the sample minimum, the lower quartile or the first quartile, the median, the upper quartile or the third quartile and the sample maximum.
In the boxplot we draw a box from the first quartile and the third quartile, a vertical line goes throught the box at the median, then the whiskers go from each quartile to the minimum or maximum.


Example & Explanationof Finding the five-number summary and of the term Quartile

A sample of 101010 boxes of raisins has these weights (in grams): 252525, 282828, 292929, 292929, 303030, 343434, 353535, 353535, 373737, 383838 Make a box plot of the data. Step 1: Order the data from smallest to largest. Our data is already in order. 252525, 282828, 292929, 292929, 303030, 343434, 353535, 353535, 373737, 383838 Step 2: Find the median. The median is the mean of the middle two numbers: 252525, 282828, 292929, 292929, 30\large{30}30, 34\large{34}34, 353535, 353535, 373737, 383838 30+34/2​=32 The median is 323232. Step 3: Find the quartiles. The first quartile is the median of the data points to the left of the median. 252525, 282828, 29\large{29}29, 292929, 303030 Q1​=29 The third quartile is the median of the data points to the right of the median. 343434, 353535, 35\large{35}35, 373737, 383838 Q3=35Q_3=35Q3​=35 Step 4: Complete the five-number summary by finding the min and the max. The min is the smallest data point, which is 252525. The max is the largest data point, which is 383838. The five-number summary is 252525, 292929, 323232, 353535, 383838.
