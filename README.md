# Boxplot

Summary of the history of the box plot.
A box plot is a visual represenation of the statistical five number summary a the data set that is given.
This includes
1.Minimum
2.First Quartile
3.Median (second quartile)
4. Third quartile
5. Maximum


Mathematican John Tukey was the first to introduce the Box and WHisker plot in 1969 to show a visual summery of the five number summary of any given data set. A man called Hadley Williams describes them, he says boxplots use robust summary statistics that are always located at actual data points, are quickly computable and have no tuning parameters, and are usefull to compare distributions across groups.
The chartio version is the closest to the original and is used to take a subset of data and quickly and visually show the five number summary data set. But in the chartio version it has a tool tip is provided that shows all of the data points summarised in the visualisation.
